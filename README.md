This repository consists of all the FreeCodeCamp Ziplines which are successfully accomplished.

# Intermediate Front End Development Projects
* Random Quote Machine selects a quote randomly from a bunch of quotes and displays it.
* Weather App consists of an API which gives us all the data needed on the basis of the person's location and from there I take the weather i.e. is it hazy, cold etc and on the basis of the temperature it changes the background.
* Wikipedia Viewer is based on the Wikipedia API which gives us the information about all the Wikipedia articles that have the searched word or phrase in them with the links of the specified articles.
* After the Wikipedia Viewer, comes the Twitch.tv JSON API project in which I used the given API to get the JSON data and from that manipulated the data to get the channel link, logo and also check whether the channel is online or not to get the show name if the same came to be online.

# Advanced Front End Development Projects
* Javascript Calculator is just a simple calculator that is made using javascript only having the main concept as the "eval" function which evaluates the arithmetic expression present in the form of a string.
    * Every button press invokes a function which adds the value of the button to the string which is finally evaluated when the = button is pressed.
    * Another thing that is taken care of here is that when the = button is pressed, if the number of operands are greater than the number of operators, then only the string is evaluated otherwise "Error" is shown.

# FreeCodeCamp
This repository consists of all the FreeCodeCamp Ziplines which are successfully accomplished.

* Random Quote Machine selects a quote randomly from a bunch of quotes and displays it.
* Weather App consists of an API which gives us all the data needed on the basis of the person's location and from there I take the weather i.e. is it hazy, cold etc and on the basis of the temperature it changes the background.
* Wikipedia Viewer is based on the Wikipedia API which gives us the information about all the Wikipedia articles that have the searched word or phrase in them with the links of the specified articles.

* Here are the Codepen links for the projects:

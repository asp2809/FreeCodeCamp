# FreeCodeCamp
This repository consists of all the FreeCodeCamp Ziplines which are successfully accomplished.

* Random Quote Machine selects a quote randomly from a bunch of quotes and displays it.
* Weather App consists of an API which gives us all the data needed on the basis of the person's location and from there I take the weather i.e. is it hazy, cold etc and on the basis of the temperature it changes the background.

* Here are the Codepen links for the projects:
